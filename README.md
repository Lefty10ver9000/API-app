My app allows users to input a movie title into a search bar that is then sent to the Open Movie Database API. 
My app then receives the release date of the movie, which it than sends to the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API. 
My app then receives the photo associated with the release date and displays the photo and release date of the movie for the user to see.
